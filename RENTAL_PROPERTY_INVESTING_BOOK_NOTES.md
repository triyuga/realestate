## 4 sources of wealth generation

There are 4 sources of wealth generation possible via property investment:

1. Appreciation
2. Cash-flow
3. Tax savings
4. Loan paydown

### Appreciation

Appreciation is an increase of the value of an asset over time.

2 kinds of appreciation in Real Estate:
1. **Natural** - natural tendency for prices to rise over time. Causitive factors including inflation, scarcity, greed. When the house your parents bought 40 years ago sells for 10x, that is natural appreciation. 
2. **Forced** - Improving a property to increase value. Examples:
    * turning 2 bedroom into 3 a bedroom
    * adding a second bathroom
    * increasing profit potential
    
House flipping capitalizes on only one of the wealth generation sources - forced appreciation.

Relying on apprecation to make a profit only is risky. Rather, view it as icing on the cake.

Investing in a location where appreciation is likely is a good idea, but do not invest in a bad or marginal deal in the hopes that appreaction will bail you out. That is speculation. 

**Your deal analysis should not ASSUME appreciation!**

Treat appreciation for what it is: a possible reward for a investment done right.


### Cash Flow

Cash-flow is the amount of income left in business after all bills are paid.

Often expressed as a monthly dollar amount.

Income left after paying out expenses that affect the property, like:
* mortgage
* taxes
* insurance
* vacancies
* repairs
* capital expeditures 
* utilities

To truely understand your cash-flow, you must truly understand income and expenses, and this is where many people struggle.

Prediciting cash-flow estimates:
* historical data
* industry averaged data

**Cash-flow is the most important wealth generator for Rental Investors.**

You want to see property is generating revenue ASAP after purchase. Don't buy a "what if".

Breaking even, or losing money is the path to financial ruin.

**Rule #1: Buy rental properties that offer cashflow today**


### Tax Savings

Can make a good deal even better. Consult your CPA (Certified Public Accountant).


### Loan paydown

You can automate part of your wealth generation, by obtaining a loan on rental property, and using the rent from your tenants to pay down the loan each month.

Part of **cash-flow** expenses is the mortgage payment.

A mortgage payment has 2 parts:
* Principal - the balance of the loan being paid down
* Interest - the profit that the lender makes, based on the interest rate you agree to pay when you secure the loan.

Balance of Principal/Interest shifts over time. Payments mostly go to interest in the beginning, then gradually shift to mostly principal over time.

**Amortization** is an accounting technique used to lower the cost value of a finite life or intangible asset incrementally through scheduled charges to income. Amortization is the paying off of debt with a fixed repayment schedule in regular installments over time like with a mortgage or a car loan.

Loan paydown wealth generation happens naturally if an investment cash-flow positive, and a portion of profit is re-invested into loan paydown.
